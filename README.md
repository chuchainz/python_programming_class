#### Tank Game ####
#### Goals:

- Implement various types of projectiles.
- Develop several target types with different movement patterns.
- Transform the cannon into a moving tank.
- Create "bombs" that will be dropped by targets onto the cannon.
- Implement multiple cannons that can shoot at each other.

#### Information: ####
To enhance the structure and design of the Cannon Game, we can adopt modular programming and object-oriented programming (OOP) principles. By dividing the code into distinct modules, each with a well-defined purpose and clear interface, we can achieve better organization and maintainability. Additionally, utilizing OOP concepts like inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism will allow for code reusability and flexibility.

To implement this, we can create separate modules for different components of the game, such as projectiles, targets, tanks, and bombs. Each module will encapsulate its functionality and provide a consistent interface for interaction with other modules. This approach promotes modularity and separation of concerns.

Furthermore, we can leverage OOP principles by defining classes that represent these components. By utilizing inheritance, we can establish a clear hierarchy of classes, where common attributes and behaviors can be inherited from a base class and specialized in derived classes. Encapsulation ensures that the internal state of each class is properly encapsulated and accessible only through well-defined interfaces. Polymorphism allows us to treat objects of different classes uniformly, simplifying code and promoting flexibility.

By combining modular programming and OOP, we can create a more structured, maintainable, and extensible codebase for the Cannon Game. This approach fosters code organization, reusability, and promotes better software design practices.
